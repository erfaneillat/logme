## 📱 Flutter Implementation (Documented - Ready to Build)

See detailed guide in `/OFFERS_MANAGEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

### What You Need to Create:

#### 1. Offer Model (`/lib/features/subscription/data/models/offer_model.dart`)
```dart
class OfferModel {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final OfferDisplay display;
  final String offerType;
  final double? discountPercentage;
  final double? discountAmount;
  final DateTime? startDate;
  final DateTime? endDate;
  final List<String> applicablePlanIds;
  final int priority;
  // ... fromJson, toJson methods
}
```

#### 2. Offer Service (`/lib/features/subscription/data/services/offer_service.dart`)
```dart
class OfferService {
  Future<List<OfferModel>> getActiveOffers() async {
    // Call GET /api/offers/active
  }
}
```

#### 3. Update Subscription Provider
Add offers to state and apply them to plans dynamically

#### 4. Update Subscription Page UI
Replace hardcoded offers with dynamic data:
- Use `offer.display.bannerText` instead of hardcoded text
- Use `offer.display.backgroundColor` and `textColor`
- Calculate countdown from `offer.endDate`
- Apply actual discounts from `offer.discountPercentage`
