# Flutter Offers Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
The offers management system has been **fully implemented** in Flutter and is now integrated with the backend.

---

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Offer Model** (`/lib/features/subscription/data/models/offer_model.dart`)

**Features:**
- ✅ Complete data model with all offer properties
- ✅ `OfferDisplayModel` for banner customization (text, colors, badges)
- ✅ JSON serialization/deserialization
- ✅ Helper methods:
  - `appliesToPlan(planId)` - Check if offer applies to a specific plan
  - `isCurrentlyValid` - Check if offer is active and within time limits
  - `timeRemaining` - Calculate time until expiration
  - `calculateDiscountedPrice(originalPrice)` - Apply discount to price
- ✅ Support for multiple offer types: percentage, fixed_amount, trial, feature

### 2. **Offer Service** (`/lib/features/subscription/data/services/offer_service.dart`)

**API Integration:**
- ✅ `getActiveOffers()` - Fetch offers applicable to current user
- ✅ `getOfferById(id)` - Fetch specific offer by ID or slug
- ✅ Error handling and fallback to empty lists
- ✅ Integrated with existing `ApiService`

### 3. **Subscription Provider** (Updated)

**New Features:**
- ✅ Loads offers in parallel with subscription plans
- ✅ Stores offers in state: `List<OfferModel> offers`
- ✅ Finds best offer for yearly plan: `OfferModel? activeOffer`
- ✅ `_findBestOffer()` method:
  - Filters offers by validity and plan applicability
  - Sorts by priority (highest first)
  - Returns the best matching offer

### 4. **Countdown Timer Widget** (`/lib/features/subscription/presentation/widgets/offer_countdown_timer.dart`)

**Features:**
- ✅ Real-time countdown timer
- ✅ Updates every second
- ✅ Shows hours:minutes:seconds format
- ✅ Persian number support
- ✅ Custom styling support
- ✅ Shows "Offer Expired" when time runs out
- ✅ Automatically cancels timer on dispose

### 5. **Subscription Page** (Updated)

**Dynamic Offer Display:**
- ✅ **Conditional rendering**: Only shows offer card if valid offer exists
- ✅ **Dynamic colors**:
  - Background color from `offer.display.backgroundColor`
  - Text color from `offer.display.textColor`
  - Automatic gradient generation (darker shade)
  - Color parsing from hex strings
- ✅ **Dynamic content**:
  - Banner text from `offer.display.bannerText`
  - Banner subtext from `offer.display.bannerSubtext`
  - Badge text support
- ✅ **Countdown timer**:
  - Shows if offer is time-limited
  - Real-time updates
  - Persian number formatting
- ✅ **Price calculation**:
  - Applies offer discount to displayed price
  - Works with both percentage and fixed amount discounts
  - Fallback to plan discount if no offer
- ✅ **Discount badge**:
  - Shows offer discount percentage with offer colors
  - Falls back to plan discount if no offer

## 🎯 How It Works

### Flow Diagram

```
1. App Launches
   ↓
2. SubscriptionProvider.build() called
   ↓
3. _fetchPrices() executes
   ↓
4. Parallel API calls:
   - getPlans(activeOnly: true)
   - getActiveOffers()
   ↓
5. Server returns offers filtered by:
   - User registration date
   - Subscription status
   - Time validity
   ↓
6. _findBestOffer() selects best offer:
   - Filters by plan applicability
   - Sorts by priority
   - Returns highest priority offer
   ↓
7. State updated with offers and activeOffer
   ↓
8. SubscriptionPage renders with offer data
   ↓
9. If offer exists & valid:
   - Shows dynamic banner with custom colors
   - Shows countdown timer
   - Applies discount to price
   - Shows offer discount badge
```

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: New User Sees Welcome Offer
```dart
// Admin creates offer:
{
  "name": "Welcome Offer",
  "display": {
    "bannerText": "خوش آمدید! 50% تخفیف",
    "backgroundColor": "#10B981",
    "textColor": "#FFFFFF"
  },
  "offerType": "percentage",
  "discountPercentage": 50,
  "targetUserType": "new",
  "conditions": {
    "userRegisteredWithinDays": 1
  }
}

// User registered < 24 hours ago
// Server returns this offer
// App displays:
// - Green banner
// - "خوش آمدید! 50% تخفیف"
// - 50% discount badge
// - Price reduced by 50%
```

#### Scenario 2: Winter Sale with Countdown
```dart
// Admin creates seasonal offer:
{
  "name": "Winter Sale 2024",
  "display": {
    "bannerText": "❄️ حراج زمستان",
    "bannerSubtext": "70% تخفیف تا پایان ژانویه",
    "backgroundColor": "#3B82F6"
  },
  "offerType": "percentage",
  "discountPercentage": 70,
  "endDate": "2025-01-31T23:59:59Z",
  "isTimeLimited": true
}

// App displays:
// - Blue banner
// - "❄️ حراج زمستان"
// - Countdown: "23:25:46"
// - 70% discount

## 📊 State Management

### SubscriptionState Structure

```dart

  final double? yearlyPrice;
  final double? yearlyDiscountPercentage;
  // ... other plan fields
  
  // NEW: Offers data
  final List<OfferModel> offers;        // All applicable offers
  final OfferModel? activeOffer;        // Best offer for selected plan
  
  // Existing fields
  final bool isLoading;
  final String? error;
}
```

### Data Flow

```
Server → OfferService → SubscriptionProvider → SubscriptionState → SubscriptionPage
         (API)        (Business Logic)         (State)             (UI)
```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

# Create offer in admin panel with:
- Name: "Test Offer"
- Banner Text: "Test Banner"
- Background: #FF0000 (red)
- Discount: 50%

## 🔧 Code Integration Points

### 1. Adding More Offer Types

To add support for new offer types (e.g., "buy_one_get_one"):

```dart
// In offer_model.dart
double calculateDiscountedPrice(double originalPrice) {
  if (offerType == 'percentage' && discountPercentage != null) {
    return originalPrice * (1 - discountPercentage! / 100);
  } else if (offerType == 'fixed_amount' && discountAmount != null) {
    return max(0, originalPrice - discountAmount!);
  } else if (offerType == 'buy_one_get_one') {
    // NEW: Implement BOGO logic
    return originalPrice * 0.5;
  }
  return originalPrice;
}
```

### 2. Applying Offers to Other Plans

Currently, offers are applied to the yearly plan. To apply to other plans:

```dart
// In subscription_provider.dart _fetchPrices()
final yearlyOffer = _findBestOffer(offers, yearlyPlan?.id);
final monthlyOffer = _findBestOffer(offers, monthlyPlan?.id);  // Add this
final threeMonthOffer = _findBestOffer(offers, threeMonthPlan?.id);  // Add this

state = state.copyWith(
  // ...
  activeOffer: yearlyOffer,
  monthlyOffer: monthlyOffer,  // Add to state
  threeMonthOffer: threeMonthOffer,  // Add to state
);
```

### 3. Tracking Offer Usage

When user completes purchase:

```dart
// In payment flow, after successful purchase
if (activeOffer != null) {
  // Call API to increment usage count
  await offerService.incrementUsageCount(activeOffer.id);
  
  // Or track locally
  analytics.logEvent('offer_used', {
    'offer_id': activeOffer.id,
    'offer_name': activeOffer.name,
    'discount': activeOffer.discountPercentage,
  });
}
```
