## 🔄 How It Works (Full Flow)

### User Attempts Image Analysis
```
1. User picks image or enters description
2. Call sent to /api/food/analyze or /api/food/analyze-description
```

### Backend Processing
```
3. Server checks if user has active subscription
   ├─ If subscribed → Allow unlimited ✅
   └─ If free tier → Continue...

4. Check daily count in DailyAnalysisLimit
   ├─ If < 3 → Allow + Increment counter ✅
   └─ If ≥ 3 → Return 403 with limit message ❌
```

### Frontend Handling
```
5. iOS/Android receives response
   ├─ 200 Success → Show food detail ✅
   └─ 403 Error → Catch FreeTierLimitExceededException

6. Show beautiful dialog with:
   ├─ Icon and title
   ├─ Server message
   ├─ Reset date
   ├─ Cancel button
   └─ Upgrade button → Navigate to subscription screen
```

## 🔌 API Response Examples

{
    "_id": ObjectId("..."),
    "userId": ObjectId("user_id"),
    "date": "2024-10-17",              // YYYY-MM-DD format
    "analysisCount": 2,                // Times analyzed today
    "createdAt": ISODate(...),
    "updatedAt": ISODate(...)
}
```

### Index
```javascript
db.dailyanalysislimits.createIndex(
    { "userId": 1, "date": 1 }, 
    { unique: true }
)
```

## 🌐 Translation Strings

Added to `assets/translations/en-US.json` and `fa-IR.json`:

```json
"free_tier_limit": {
    "title": "Free Tier Limit Reached",
    "message": "You've reached the free tier image analysis limit. Please upgrade to the premium plan to continue using this feature.",
    "upgrade_button": "Upgrade Now",
    "learn_more": "Learn More"
}
```

Persian translations are also included in `fa-IR.json`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Free Tier Limit
Located in: `server/src/services/imageAnalysisLimitService.ts`
```typescript
const FREE_USER_DAILY_LIMIT = 3;
```

To change the limit, update this constant and redeploy the server.

### Reset Time
Resets daily at **midnight (00:00)** in server timezone.

## 📌 Important Notes

1. **Subscription Check First**: Subscribed users never see the limit dialog
2. **Atomic Database Operations**: Uses MongoDB upsert for thread safety
3. **Non-blocking Errors**: If the limit check fails, analysis proceeds (safety first)
4. **Date Format**: Uses `YYYY-MM-DD` format consistently with existing code
5. **Fail-Open Strategy**: System defaults to allowing analysis if there's an error
6. **Auto-Navigation**: Frontend automatically navigates to subscription on upgrade
