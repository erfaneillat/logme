# Subscription Plan Image Upload Implementation

## Overview
Implemented image upload functionality for subscription plans, allowing admin users to upload images via the panel that are displayed in the Flutter app subscription page.

## Changes Made

### Backend (Server)

#### 1. Database Model (`server/src/models/SubscriptionPlan.ts`)
- Added `imageUrl?: string` field to the `ISubscriptionPlan` interface
- Added `imageUrl` field to the Mongoose schema

#### 2. Controller (`server/src/controllers/subscriptionPlanController.ts`)
- Added `imageUrl` parameter handling in `createPlan` and `updatePlan` methods
- Implemented `uploadPlanImage(id)` method for image uploads using multer
- Implemented `deletePlanImage(id)` method to delete plan images
- Added `deleteImageFile()` helper method to clean up image files from disk
- Updated `deletePlan` to automatically delete associated images

#### 3. Routes (`server/src/routes/subscriptionPlanRoutes.ts`)
- Added multer configuration for plan image uploads (5MB limit, image files only)
- Created uploads directory at `server/uploads/plans`
- Added route: `POST /:id/image` - Upload image for a plan
- Added route: `DELETE /:id/image` - Delete plan image
- Added route: `GET /images/:filename` - Serve plan images
- Added `imageUrl` to validation schemas

### Panel (Admin Frontend)

#### 1. Types (`panel/src/types/subscriptionPlan.ts`)
- Added `imageUrl?: string` to `SubscriptionPlan` interface
- Added `imageUrl?: string` to `CreatePlanInput` interface

#### 2. Service (`panel/src/services/subscriptionPlan.service.ts`)
- Implemented `uploadPlanImage(token, id, imageFile)` method
- Implemented `deletePlanImage(token, id)` method

#### 3. Plans Page (`panel/src/pages/PlansPage.tsx`)
- Added image upload UI to the create/edit modal:
  - Image preview component
  - File input with image selection
  - Upload button with size and format hints (5MB max)
  - Delete button for existing images
- Added image display in plan cards (140px height)
- State management for selected image and preview
- Automatic image upload after plan creation/update
- Image error handling with fallback

### Flutter App

#### 1. Model (`lib/features/subscription/data/models/subscription_plan_model.dart`)
- Added `imageUrl?: String` field
- Updated `fromJson` to parse imageUrl
- Updated `toJson` to include imageUrl

#### 2. Provider (`lib/features/subscription/presentation/providers/subscription_provider.dart`)
- Added `monthlyImageUrl`, `threeMonthImageUrl`, `yearlyImageUrl` to `SubscriptionState`
- Updated `_fetchPrices()` to populate image URLs from fetched plans
- Updated `copyWith()` method to include image URLs

#### 3. Subscription Page (`lib/features/subscription/pages/subscription_page.dart`)
- Updated `_buildHeroSection` to accept and display plan images
- Image priority: Yearly â†’ 3-Month â†’ Monthly â†’ Default Unsplash fallback
- Constructs full image URL using `ApiConfig.baseUrl + imageUrl`
- Maintains existing error handling for failed image loads

## Features

### Panel Features
- âœ… Upload images when creating new plans
- âœ… Upload/change images when editing existing plans
- âœ… Delete images from plans
- âœ… Image preview in modal
- âœ… Image display in plan cards
- âœ… File validation (5MB max, image formats only)
- âœ… Automatic cleanup of old images when uploading new ones

### Flutter Features
- âœ… Display plan images in hero section of subscription page
- âœ… Fallback to default image if no plan image is available
- âœ… Priority system (yearly > 3-month > monthly)
- âœ… Error handling for failed image loads

## API Endpoints

### Image Management
- `POST /api/subscription-plans/:id/image` - Upload plan image (multipart/form-data, field: "image")
- `DELETE /api/subscription-plans/:id/image` - Delete plan image
- `GET /api/subscription-plans/images/:filename` - Serve plan images

### Image Storage
- Location: `server/uploads/plans/`
- Naming: `plan-{timestamp}-{random}.{ext}`
- Cleanup: Automatic deletion when plan is deleted or image is replaced

## Usage

### Uploading Images via Panel
1. Navigate to Plans page
2. Create new plan or edit existing plan
3. Click "ðŸ“· Upload Image" in the modal
4. Select an image file (max 5MB)
5. Preview appears immediately
6. Save the plan - image uploads automatically
7. To change image: click "ðŸ“· Change Image"
8. To remove image: click "Delete" button on the preview

### Viewing Images in Flutter App
- Images automatically appear in the subscription page hero section
- If multiple plans have images, yearly plan takes priority
- If no plan images exist, default placeholder is shown

## Technical Notes

- Image uploads use `multer` with disk storage
- Images are validated by MIME type and file extension
- Old images are automatically cleaned up to prevent orphaned files
- All image operations are authenticated (admin-only)
- Flutter app constructs full URLs using environment-aware base URL
- Images are cached by the network layer for performance

## Migration
No database migration required - `imageUrl` is an optional field and existing plans work without it.

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Upload image when creating a new plan
- [ ] Upload image when editing an existing plan

- [ ] Delete plan with image (verify image file is removed)
- [ ] View plan image in Flutter app
- [ ] Test image fallback when no image exists
- [ ] Test image error handling (invalid URL, network error)
- [ ] Verify 5MB file size limit
- [ ] Verify only image files are accepted
